Choosing a broker? Donâ€™t just pick the one with the lowest spreads. Hereâ€™s what really matters:

### ðŸ§© Key Factors:
1. **Regulation & Licensing**
   - Ensure theyâ€™re licensed in major financial hubs (e.g., FCA, ASIC, FSCA).
2. **Execution Speed**
   - Fast execution reduces slippage and improves trade quality.
3. **Spreads & Commissions**
   - Check their fee structure â€” some offer zero commissions but wider spreads.
4. **Deposit & Withdrawal Options**
   - Are methods fast, local, and secure?
5. **Trading Platforms**
   - MT4/MT5, cTrader, web-based platforms?
6. **Support**
   - 24/7 live chat or only email? Test response times.
7. **Account Types**
   - Do they offer demo, micro, standard, and pro accounts?
